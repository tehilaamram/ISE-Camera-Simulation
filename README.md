# Camera-Simulation
This project simulates 3D camera. <br/>
The simulator was developed by Agile methodology, first developing a basic system and then refactoring and upgrading. <br/>
JUnit tests are being used for checking the system by rendering images: tests -> imageTests.java <br />
Examples of images from the tests:
* Recursive test <br/>
